# React and Redux, Webpack 2 boilerplate



## ABOUT

The basic for this project's code base was taken from Stanko's React-redux-webpack2 boilerplate found at <https://github.com/Stanko/react-redux-webpack2-boilerplate>.

Because state management is not currently needed in this project, I've deleted the Redux portion of the boilerplate.


## TODO
