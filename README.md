## ABOUT

### Code Base
The basic for this project's code base was taken from Stanko's React-redux-webpack2 boilerplate found at <https://github.com/Stanko/react-redux-webpack2-boilerplate>.

Because state management is not extensively needed in this project currently, I've deleted the Redux portion of the boilerplate.

### Blog Posts
The tool used for the generation of blog post html content is Frola.
