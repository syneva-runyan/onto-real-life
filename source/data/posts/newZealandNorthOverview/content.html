<h3>"Cities"</h3>
 <p>I expected New Zealand to be small, but you know that stat about there being more sheep in New Zealand than people? Completely accurate.
 (<em>What do you call a town so small that there isn't even a pub?</em>)</p>
 <p>Kiwis are very generous people however, and they make fantastic coffee.  Even the gas stations have manned (decent tasting) espresso machines.
Gas station coffee tends to cost ~$4 nzd, which is cheaper than the usual $4.50 you pay for a cup everywhere else.  If that seems expensive to you, it should.  <bold>Everything is so expensive here.</bold>  When you find a pint somewhere for $7.50 nzd, you stay at the pub. $7.50 is so much cheaper than the $10 you'll pay anywhere else.</p> 
<p>Of the cities I visited, Auckland, Whangarai, Napier, and Wellington were the ones big enough to taking note of.</p>
<p><bold><em>Auckland: </em></bold> Clean, has more people than anywhere else in the country, but that's still only 1.38 million.  Pretty low key, with considerably less culture than other places I've been, but has a great musuem. Best part of being in Auckland was the easy access a series of islands off it's coast, including Waiheke, where you can spend a day drinking wine and hiking (see<a href="#wine"> wine</a> below).</p>

</figure>
<p><bold><em>Whangarai: </em></bold> Cute town with a lovely town centre.  Not much to do here, more of a base for several great hikes in the area (<a href="">hiking catlogue here</a>.) For any architecture nerds out there, there is a bridge in the city renown for winning numerous design awards (pic below) that you can walk over on a lovely bay path, best done at sunset. There is also a kiwi house(<em>Bird, not people</em>) and local history museum with a full <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moa">Mao skelaton</a> worth checking out.  The city is near Poor Knights Island, which is supposed to have some of the greatest scuba diving in the world. I'm not certified yet, but plan on coming back one day to do some dives.  Preferably in the summer.  </p>

<p><bold><em>Napier: </em></bold> See <a href="#wine">wine</a> below. Considers itself an Art Deco capital and does not disappoint. People were so overly friendly and happy here. We were given discounts or deals at the hostel, bike shop, and gas station just for showing up and smiling. I'd be just as happy if I lived somewhere so beautiful.</p>

On the drive into the city, there is also one of the most impressive car collections I've ever seen.  (<em><a href="https://www.southwardcarmuseum.co.nz/">Southward Car Museum</a></em>)</p>

<h3>Culture/History</h3>
<p class="quote">The oldest records of people on New Zealand date back 900 years ago.  That's half a blink in comparison to the 9,0000+ years the aboriganies have lived in Australia.</p>
<figure class="align-right  margin--left width--20">

<p>Years ago, a group of Polynesian natives noticed birds flying away every year in an unmapped direction.  They desided to follow these birds, and lo-and-behold - they found New Zealand!</p>
<p>The Maori are well known for the Haka, or War Dance. It invovles widening eyes, movement of the hands, and extrusion of the tounge.  The idea is to become mentally and physically psyed before a battle and to terrify the enemy.
<em>On a scale of would or would not intimidate me on the street, the Haka would win.</em></p>
<p>A small village in Rotorua name Tewhakarewarewatangaoteopetauaawahio offered a tour and lunch in a living Maori village.</p>
<p>I didn't take many pictures here because it felt rude snapping pictures of someone's home, like they were part of a zoo, but I've grabbed some from google to make up for it.</p>
<p class="quote">Tewhakarewarewatangaoteopetauaawahio.  Yes that's a real name of a real place.</p>
<p>I paid ~$50nzd for the tour and lunch. There was comprable experience next door for about ~$80 more, but reportedly the experiences are comprable. I wouldn't recomend the lunch to anyone going. Some of the food is from the supermarket, and there was nothing cerimonous when it was served.</p>

<p>Facts I learned:</p> <ul>
	<li>The facial tatoos represent ancestory, accomplishments, and skills.</li>
	<li>While men get full facial tatoos, women's tatoos are restricted to their chins.</li>
	<li>Both tatoos are carved into the skin with animal bones, rather than with ink inserted under the skin.</li>
	<li>The Maori used to eat the brains of their enemies as a sign of disrespect and an attempt to gain knowlege.</li>
<li>You don't wear shoes inside a Marae (traditional gathering place) because the god of peace lives inside.  The god of war rules the earth outside.  <em>It's not best practice to track bits of war dirt into a peace zone.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>I could go on and on here, but know spouting facts can get boring.  If you're interested though, jump online and do some reading. You won't be disappointed.</p>
<p>Something you won't find much information on online about is the theory that there were people living in New Zealand before the Maori.  
Suspiciously inline rocks across the country and sparce archelogical evidence on small offshore islands offer circumstancial evidence of this.  Because of the land right battles and tension between European colonials and Maoris that claim historical rights, these theories are being swept under the carpet. (<em>Thanks Britain.</em>)</p>

<h3>Outdoors</h3>
<p>You're not allowed to bring any used camping equiptment into New Zealand. Customs agents at the airport check for dirt on hiking shoes. I even declared my running shoes.  At the entrance of most of the hikes I took up north, there were shoe cleaning stations at both the start and end.
Like most islands, New Zealand has a unique, fragile ecosystem, and kiwis pride themselves on taking care of it.</p>
<h4>Geothermal Wonderland</h4>
<p>In Rotorua, the Earth's crust is thinner than in most place around the world.  As a result, there are active gysers, mud pools, and the whole city smells generally of rotten egg.</p>
<p>The boiling mud pools reminded me of <em>The Land Before Time</em> and the minerals in Lake Rotura gave it a beautiful blue color I thought existed only in water color paintings.</p>
<p>There is also a random Redwood forest in Rotura. Not much to say about that other than it was interesting and had some good short hiking.</p>

<h4>Hiking</h4>
<p class="quote">What better way to spend a casual Tuesday than hiking up a volcano?</p>
<p>But really, how cool is it that I can say that? New Zealand is famous for it's beautiful hikes, and it's half the reason why I wanted to go here.</p>
<p class="quote">For people who are serious about hiking, the Te Araroa is a 300 km route that goes around the north and south islands, taking ~5 months to complete.</p>
<figure class="align-right margin--left" style="width: 200px;">
	<img src="../assets/img/blogs/newZealandNorthOverview/crossingStart.jpg" />
	<figcaption class="caption">Checkout the <a href="/posts/newZealandNorthHiking">hiking catalogue</a> for more</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>It's winter and it takes me a full box of matches to start a small fire, so I'm sticking to the day hikes.  Rather than go over each of them in this post, I've <a href="/posts/newZealandNorthHiking"> compiled a separate catalogue here.</a></p>
<p>It's worth calling out the Tongariro Crossing here though.  The crossing is considered one of the best day hikes in the world.  Despite rainy, cold weather for the seconday half, It didn't disappoint.</p>
</br>
<h4>Whanganui River</h4>
<p class="quote">The Whanganui Journey is one of the nine <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_Great_Walks">great walks of New Zealand</a>.  It's particularly famous for being leisurely boat ride down New Zealand's longest navigable river, not a walk.</p>
<p>With the three of us going down the river and our driver, we nearly doubled the population of Whakapapa (population 8), the drop off point for the boat ride.</p>
<p class="quote">
	<em>Fun fact: </em> WH on the north island is pronounce like an F.  Try reading Whakapapa outloud in a New Zealand accent.
</p>
<p>Mornings on the river were cold and foggy, but the boating was smooth. You only have to paddle ~50% of the time to make it down the river, barring bad weather or headwinds.</p>
<figure class="align-left margin--right width--25">
	<img src="../assets/img/blogs/newZealandNorthOverview/river.jpg"/>
</figure>
<p>Staying at the huts along the river were adventures on their own.  The first night, we shared the cabin with a group of goat hunters.  They sat across the table from us, one pounding beer like he was a dehydrated college freshman, cleaning out their guns for the next day. Not sure I've even been that close to so many guns before.<em>(Not saying much for my 'murica status.)</em></p>
<p>After dinner (a 'boilup'' which they kindly shared with us), a group of them layed on their mattresses outside, curled up in their blankets, and fell asleep watching Mohana.</p>
<p class="quote">Goat hunting.  What a job.</p>
<p>Night two, we had the hut all to ourselves.  We were (I was atleast) freezing cold, and it took a whole box of matches & a wallet full of train ticket receipts to start the fire.  We couldn't get the gas cooker working, so resorted to cooking dinner over the fire.</p>

 <h4>Waitomo Caves</h4>
<p>A handful of outdoor companies offer glowworm "adventure" tours. Supposedly, they're almost all alike.</p>
<figure class="align-left margin--right width--20 sm-width--100">
	<img src="../assets/img/blogs/newZealandNorthOverview/caving.jpg" />
	<figcaption class="caption">Take from website, since I wasn't about to bring my camera caving.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The tour was challenging, exhausting, and rewarding.  I can now add abseiling to my list of caving experiences</p>
<p><em>Abseiling: A controlled rope decent along a rockface. In this case, the drop was 27 meters, 88 feet, or 8 stories.  Whichever sounds higher.</em></p>
<p>The glow worms in the cave surpassed my expectations. We sat in a cavern so dark that you couldn't see your hand in front of your face.  From the moment the headlamps went off, light specs glowed on the ceiling.  Ten seconds in, the light specs doubled. Twenty seconds in - there were full constellations.</p>
<p>As beautiful as they were, we also learned about the not-so-dreamy parts of glow worms' lives.  First off, glow worms aren't worms.  They're maggots. When the first in a group of the maggot eggs hatch, they look around for food and canabilistically turn to their brother and sisters who haven't quite made it out yet. In the next stage of their lives, they hang from ceilings, dropping silk strings down to catch insects attracted to the biolumience glowing from next to their butt. Once adult, they have no stomaches, so live only a short period, finding a mate, reproducing, and dying.  What bizarre, beautiful creatures.</p>
<p>The day after the blackwater rafting tour, I went to the tourist glow worm cave, ready to take pictures.  Within the first five minutes, I found out that no cameras were allowed.  Opps.  The tourist cave was beautiful, but the tour was bland and short enough that I felt short change for the cost, but long enough that I tired of the guide. I'd recomend doing one of the adventure tours over the main tourist cave, assuming you're ok with dark spaces, long drops, and ocassional rock climbs.</p>

<h4>Cathedral Cove Kayaking (HaiHai)</h4>

<p><em>Blowholes:</em> Portions on a rock coast where over thousands of years the ocean has hallowed out a cave. The ceiling eventually collapses, opening up a hole where water can burst through in a spectacular show of power.</p>
<p><em>Shag Birds: </em> Appropriately named, as the warm north New Zealand climate screws up their mating patterns, and they go at it throughout the year. (<em>Tour guide's wording</em>)</p>
<p><em>$100,000: </em> Max fine for illegal fishing in protected areas. Who has that much money? Maybe the inventor of the dog sausage, who lived in a mansion on one of the hills off the coast in HaiHai.  <em>Sausage made for dogs, not of.</em></p>
<p>I learn this and so much more on my Kayak tour.  Also got a semi-decent picture of Cathedral Cove from my phone, and let's be honest - That's why I went to HaiHai.</p>
<h4>Bush Hut</h4>
<p>I booked an airbnb hut for my four night stay in Whangarai. It advertised a comfortable bed, shower, laundry, and a kitchen.  In actuality, there was a pull out sofa, a solar shower, and a gas stove.  No laundry machine to be found. 
<p class="quote">I wrote in my journal the first night that if I could survive four nights in a bush hut without heat, wifi, power, or a working toilet, I could survive anything. </br></br> I checked into a hotel the next morning.</p>
<p><bold><em>Biggest pro of the stay: </em></bold> Making pancakes and coffee on the backporch surrounded by bush</p>

	<figcaption class="caption">Mudbrick, one of the most romantic vinyards in the world.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>New Zealand is famous for it's wine, which tends to be light and sweet.  Even people who don't like wine can apperciate the joy of spending a day walking or biking in the sun between wineries and enjoying fine wine for free or cheap.</p>
<p><bold>If that's not something you can enjoy, I can't be friends with you.  Sorry not sorry.</bold></p>
<p>On the island of Waiheke, I walked between vinyards, enjoying expansive views of sheep fields, pretending I could afford the housing there (<em>$600,000 nzd compared to national average of $447,272 nzd</em>).</p>
</p>
<p>One of the vinyards, <em>Mudbrick</em> is owned by two accountants who, in their late twenties, said screw up, quit their jobs, and opened a winery.  Considering this as a future career model.</p>
</p>
<p>Napier and Hawkes Bay is another New Zealand region famous for wine. There a handful of bike shops from which you can grab a map and spend an afternoon or full day biking along well maintained trails.</p>
<p>There are also guided tours you can take here, but on a nice day there's no reason why you can't do the ride on your own. <em>Disclaimer: We did take one or two wrong turns here, but that's part of the adventure.</em></p>
<p>These trail go along the coast, through sheep fields, and right past some (in my case) fall-clad vinyards.</p>

<h4>Lord of the Rings</h4>
<p>You can't get into New Zealand without having seen Lord of the Rings.  Pretty sure that's a rule.  Like they ask at customs, and kick you out if you haven't.</p>
<p>But really, getting to see Hobbiton and the Weta Cave workshop (where prop work was done for <em>Lord of the Rings</em>) were quintessential New Zealand experiences.</p>
<p>In summation of <bold>Hobbiton</bold>: Peter Jackson is crazy.  It's very unusual to build a set out of permanent material (like Hobbiton is), it costs alot of money.  The tree above Baggens has over 5,000 hand painted leaves, hand painted because they were made the wrong color.  Locals were encourage to be extras in the film as long as they were short and had big noses.</p>

<p>Creatures like golum first have a replica skull designed.  From there, fake muscles are applied. Only then is the face crafted.  This is how they're able to create such a wide range of motions for their characters.</p>
<p>I also learned here that the actor who plays Aragorn (<em>Viggo Mortensen</em>) is a method actor.</p>

<h4>Traveling</h4>
<p class="quote">Out of breath, you finally make it to the top of a 1,500 step hill... and then you realize you took a wrong turn at the bottom.</p>
<p>Both literally and metaphorically, this happened multiple times during my first week in New Zealand. Jetlag from my 26 hour journey set me back for a week. I can't image spending or recommending anyone spend less than two weeks over here.</p>
<p>I've known that I'm bad at adjusting to jet lag.  Another thing I'm bad with: Cold weather.  I was worried that coming to New Zealand would take so much out of the experience.  One one hand, I haven't been able to enjoy the beaches, and it rains more this time of year than summer, which makes for less pretty sights and pictures. On the other hand, hostels and activities are cheaper and easier to book.  I can show up day of somewhere and get a space on almost any tour.  Twice now (once in Waitimo, and again on the North Island yesterday) I've been the only person in my hostel.  This makes for a strange experience, but sometimes when traveling, surrounded by constant movement, it's nice to have a break and spend some time alone.</p>
<p>It's also helped that it isn't proper winter yet. It's still the fall, the leaves are changing and falling, and some of the hikes I've done have been more breath taking than I could image.</p>
<p>I'm heading down south now, and winter is actually coming. To be seen if my optimism and positive weather experiences will hold.</p>

Thanks for hanging in til the end. Special shout out to Henry, Mark, and every one of the other fantastic people I've met traveling so far if you're reading this.  I'm looking forward to seeing the south island next, especially the Winter Festival in Queenstown later this month.  Hang in for that post (<em>assuming I don't turn into an icicle between now and then.  I give that a 75% chance of happening</em>).  Until then, bye folks!</p>
