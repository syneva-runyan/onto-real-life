        This past weekend I joined my friend Jessie for the first 52 miles of
        the{" "}
        <a href="http://www.aztrail.org/" target="blank">
          Arizonia trail <em>(excuse the crappy website)</em>.
        </a>{" "}
        The trail traverses 800 miles of Arizonia, going through canyons, around
        buttes, and across deserts.
      </p>
      <p>
        The portion I hiked covers just 1/16th of what Jessie is doing over the
        next 7 weeks, and is only 1/44th of what she walked when thru-ing the
        appalacian trail in 2016.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nevertheless, the three and a half days I spent not showering, setting
        up and packing out camp in freezing weather, and nursing numerous
        injuries gave me <em>some (if limited)</em> insight into what it's like
        to long distance hike.
      </p>
      <p>Jessie's categories of "fun" help to contextualize the experience.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <strong>There are three categories of fun.</strong>
        <br />
        <br />
        <em>Category One:</em> Things in this category are both fun to do, and
        fun to talk about.<br />
        <br />
        <em>Category Two:</em> This category consists of things that are{" "}
        <strong>not</strong> fun to do, but <strong>are</strong> fun to talk
        about.<br />
        <br />
        <em>Category Three:</em> These things are <strong>not</strong> fun to do
        and <strong>not</strong> fun to talk about.
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Long distance backpacking hardlines at category two fun. One my hike, I
        learned about the incredible amount tenacity required on a long hike,
        the importance of good equiptment, and the mental reflections that
        happen on category-2 fun trips.

        If you're long distance hiking, you will be in pain{" "}
        <em>
          (Or atleast at the start of your hike as your body adjusts to it's new
          routine)
        </em>. The line that separates "tolerable" pain and pain that you need
        to listen to seems to me thinner than the tip of a needle. Will those
        quater sized blisters on your heels end up popping and calousing in a
        few days? How about your knee that's hurting? Will the muscles around it
        strengthen enough to relieve the pain?

      <blockquote>
        {" "}As your boby screams it's misfortunes at you after a 16 mile day,
        you need the mental strength and attitude to block out temporary pain,
        and the maturity to handle and acknowlege what could be a real problem.

        Because of the physical and mental strength required to get through a
        long distance hike, backpackers are some of the most tencious people I
        know.

        <em>
          Stand up straighter, it's harder now but'll help build up better abs,
          and once you have a six pack, the backpack will feel so much ligher.
        </em>
      </p>
      <p>Those are the types of thoughts I now associate with backpackers.</p>
      <p>
        Something I was completely unprepared for during my hike was the
        importance of good equipment.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I'm only going for four days</em> I scoffed at the idea of investing
        in a sleeping bag smaller than the elephant sized one I packed.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>
          Even though I literly have to step on my backpack to stuff the bag
          into my pack, and even though it takes no less than two minutes to go
          through this process, and even though the backpack barely shuts once
          the collasal sized sleeping bag is stuffed in... I'll be fine.
        </em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Well, it turns out I really, really wished I had invested in not just a
        smaller (and more light weight) sleeping bag. I wish I had invested in
        better equiptment all around. Thankfully, my friends Carleigh and Josh
        had last minute let me borrow their camelback for the hike, or else I
        don't think I would have stayed hydrated. Stopping to open my pack, move
        my sleeping bag out of the way, pour myself a cup of water from a jug to
        refill a smaller bottle I could carry outside my pack... While possible,
        that certainly would have been an inconvience and slowed us down, even
        more so than I was already slowing us down with my snail-like uphill
        pace.
      </p>
      <p>
        I thought Jessie was borderline crazy when she showed me the things she
        had done/purchased to help make an "ultralight" pack. By the end of the
        first day I was in awe of her intellegence as I dropped/threw my much
        heavier 35lb pack on the ground to make camp. The importance of not
        short changing on equiptment is probably the most valuable lesson I
        learned on this backpacking trip.

        When you're hikiing in the middle of nowhere for days on end, you have a
        lot of time to think, to set expectations for yourself for the day, to
        realign those expectations as that day goes on, and to reflect on
        various things of life.
      </p>
      <p>
        This last point, reflection on life, is something alot of people seek in
        nature and in travel more generally. In my experiences and in other's{" "}
        <em>
          (I'm taking the liberty to extrapolate from conversations and personal
          thoughts)
        </em>, you aren't likely to answer big life questions during these
        reflections.

        When walking miles and milles, I wonder why the cacti seem to be happy
        growing in the shade, if there are ticks about to jump out and latch
        onto me from out of nowhere, if Shia Labeouf's craziness has peaked, or
        if he's going to keep on keeping on with his elevation to insanity. If I
        answer any life-questions hiking, it'll be because the temporary escape
        from a busy reality cleared my mind of distractions, kind of like when
        you leaving a math problem for 30 minutes and then come back to it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sometimes though, like with the math problem, you come back to reality
        just as confused and stumped as you left it, and that's ok. The
        important things is that you gave yourself a break.
      </p>
      <p>
        Life's a process of setting expectation and adjusting them as you and
        the world around you change. Only going 13 miles when you were aiming
        for 16 isn't a bad thing, you still did freaking 13 miles.

        Three days after getting off the trail, I still can't straighten my knee
        all the way without pain. The chaffing on my shoulder from the
        way-too-heavy pack I carried is getting better, but gives off the
        impression that I had a run in with a mini version one of Elon Musk's
        flame throwers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite these temporary injuries, I'm really proud of myself for doing
        52 miles on a trail. I'm even more proud of and am impressed with Jessie
        for <em>still</em> being on the trail. Long distance hikers like her
        have a tenacity that I admire. I'm hoping to get on another long
        distance trail again, maybe not a thru hike, maybe just a segment
        somewhere I can do over a weekend with my new (soon to own)
        lightweight-and-reasonably-sized sleeping bag. Until then, I'm back to a
        new job, a ridiculous amount of grad school work to catch up on, and
        plenty of life-questions just waiting to be forgotten on that next
        category-2-fun trip.
