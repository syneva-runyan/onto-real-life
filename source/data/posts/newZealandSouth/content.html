<p>There is <strong>So. Much. To. Do.</strong> on the south island, where do I even start?</p>
<p class="quote">I've probably listened to the song "99 Red Baloons" more than once for every baloon in the song.</p>
<p>And why, you ask, have I listened to that song <strong>So. Many. Times</strong>?  There is <strong>So. Much. Driving</strong> to do on the South Island <em>(and I have a severly lacking music library)</em>.</p>
<p>Everything is spread out, and there's the added inconvience of mountains.  One can not simply drive over the Southern Alps<em> (lotr reference was overdue)</em>.</p>

<p>Partly due of this distance between things, and partly due to the sheer amount of things to do, the three weeks I spent on the south island were not enough.  Gathered from talking to people at hostels, <strong>six weeks</strong> would have been more appropriate.  Add a few longer hikes on to that - you could easily spent two months in New Zealand just on the south island.</p>

<p>There is that whole winter thing though...  So I'm headed off to somewhere warmer next week (Indonesia, whoopp), and'll plan on returning when it's warmer and camping/hiking is possible without the constant risk of turning into an ice cube.</p> 
<p>From the peanut butter factory, to climbing on a glacier, to hating myself for hiking two and a half hours straight uphill - what I did fit in into the last three weeks has been nothing short of phenomenal.  Rather than writting an exhaustive narrative of everything, I've compiled a top-10 list.  It's made up of a mixture of hiking, outdoor activities, random places, and events.  Even though they may seem unrelated, all of them epitomise quintesential aspects of the Southern kiwi experience.</p>

<p>Am I too young to retire?</p>
<p>I could happily live out the end of my days admiring mountains surrounding the serene lake front and taking short (or long) day hikes every morning in Wanaka.</p>
<p>The hike to Roy's Peak here is <a target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/locations/348092887/roys-peak/">instagram-famous.</a>  When I read the DOC's (Department of Conservation's) description of the track as "demanding," with a time estimate of 5-6 hours, I scoffed.  <em>Psh... </em> The estimates are always overdone, and from the car park at the peak's base, the "mount" looks more like a large hill.</p>
<p>Holy crap I was wrong.</p>
<p>There are no downhill breaks, no meanandering flat sections on the hike up. No exaggeration, the hiking trail goes uphill for <em>two and a half hours</em> straight.</p>
<p>Alot of people make it the two hours up to the picture viewpoint then turn around.  Doing the extra 30 minutes up to the peak is well worth the effort though.</p>
<p class="quote">I claim bragging rights for making it all the way up.</p>

<h3>2. The Peanut Butter Factory (Nelson)</h3>

<p>Naturally, as soon as I realized peanut butter factories existed and that there was one in Nelson that gave tours, I had to go.  This wasn't an option, or a <em>"if I have time,"</em> or <em>"if I feel like it"</em> thing.  <strong>Had. To. Go.</strong></p>
<p>The tour included peanut butter tasting, a make-your-own-peanut-butter segment, and a brief history of the <a target="blank" href="https://www.picspeanutbutter.com/go-to-stories/stories/nice-to-see-you-lovely-peanut-butter-lover/">founder</a>, who used to own laundry mats, then started going blind at 55 (from macular degeneration) and needed a new proffession.</p>
<p>While I do love peanut butter and 100% loved the tour, I didn't pick Pic's for my top 10 list for being amazing in itself.  It's representative of a number of small, passionate, community focused businesses I came across on the South island.</p>
<p>Pic's does things like donate free peanut butter for school lunches across Nelson.  When the hand-automated process of filling peanut butter jars was replaced with machines, employees were promoted or re-assigned instead of fired.</p>

<p>Since I'm trying not to go broke, I wasn't able to go paragliding and jet boating and canyon swinging... but I did atleast go Bungy jumping in Queenstown.</p>
<p>After an interesting history of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bungy.co.nz/who-we-are/history">fed-up wives and evil spirits,</a> modern Bungy jumping was reportedly invented outside of Queenstown during the 80s.</p>
<p>I jumped off the Kawarau Bridge, one of the first public Bungy sites in the World.  I love heights, but there was a little voice screaming in the back of my head when I stepped off the bridge (<em>ok, so it wasn't in my head, I actually screamed</em>), because I really didn't want to die.</p>
<p><strong>@Mark</strong> thanks for going with me! <strong>@Molly,</strong> pick a place, looking forward to jumping again with you!</p>

<h3>4. Stewart & Ulva Islands</h3>

<p>Outside of Dunedin, people pay $100+ nzd to see albatross in an exhibit (<em>Albatrosses? What is the plural of albatross?</em>).  On a ferry to Ulva (small wildlife reserve island) from Stewart Island, an albatross took interest in out boat and landed in the water right off the port side.(<em>Both me and the proffessional photographer I was chatting with had our lens caps on...</em>)</p>
<p>Even as someone who knows very little about birds, I loved being on Stewart Island and discovering a wide array of wildlife on beautiful coast and bush hikes.

<h3>5. Ice Explorer Tour (Franz Joseph)</h3>
<p><em>"Ice Explorer"</em> was a little bit of a misnomer for the tour I did, since the group moved at a pace of ~less than 0.5mph.  Nevertheless, getting to fly on a helicopter, wearing crampons for the first time, and shuffling through ice tunnel was something I won't forget.</p>
<p>Because of the recession of the Franz Joseph and Fox glaciers in the past few years (<em>thanks Donald Trump and global warming</em>), the only way to access the glacier is via helicopter, which makes tours expensive. Ontop of the expense, the weather around Franz Joseph and the Fox Glaciers are so variable, that there's a good chance on any given day that helicopters won't be able to land, either canceling your trip, or stranding you on the glacier overnight.</p>

<p>I wasn't stranded, but my first trip was canceled.  Our group made it was far as zipping up our provided tour jackets before they called it.  I got to reschedule for 8am the next morning, but alot of people weren't hanging around and just had to get refunds.</p>
