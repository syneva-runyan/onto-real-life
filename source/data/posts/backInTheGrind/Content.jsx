      <p>I landed back to Atlanta after taking six months off to travel on a Thursday, and re-started my full time job the following Monday.</p>
      <p>In the next two months, I found a new apartment. I had to furnish that apartment to make it liveable (I didn't own so much as a decent bath towel).
        Unhappy with my current job, I started to look for a new job.  I started hanging out more and more with my friend Kyle (who later became my boyfriend).
        I did my best to reconnect with friends I hadn't seen in the two years since I left for London.
      </p>
      <p>
        Within three months, I had taken a new job, and started weekly trips to Chicago for that new job.
        That adjustment was difficult for me, especially considering the change in climate between Atlanta and Chicago in the winter.

      <blockquote>
        Needless to say, I was overwhelmed with the number of changes in my life when I got back from traveling.
      </blockquote>
      <p>Six months into life back home, I went on a family vacation, something my family of 7 hadn't even tried to do in over a decade. The differences between that trip and the six months I had spent backpacking were stark.  The most obvious difference: There was nearly enough time to learn much about or get a feel for where were vacationing.</p>
      <p>I really wanted to talk to someone in person about how different those experiences were, but none of my friend in Atlanta had taken or had the opportunity to do a backpacking trip like I did. Which I totally understand.</p>
      <p><strong>Start tangent</strong></p>
      <p> My backpacking trip was a privelege I was afforded. I'm incredibly lucky that I made enough money to save for a trip like that.</p>
      <p>That being said, I also met so many people traveling who had worked minimum wage jobs, and prioritized saving for a backpacking trip, because that was something they really wanted to do. Uber drivers, store managers, construction workers...</p>
      <p>Other people I met flew to the other side of the world without much savings, intent of finding jobs, experiencing other parts of the world from a new city they could work in, taking time off when they could. Or maybe they'd travel for the summer, then find a seasonal job in another country for a few months, save up, and then traveling again.</p>
      <p>The decision to travel isn't for everyone, and I completely understand people's decisions to prioritize other aspects of their lives. I also understand that some people have commitments that make traveling incredibly difficult to do.</p>
      <p>I really believe though, that in most cases, if someone is passionate enough and commited enough to make it happen, they can take time off of "real life" to experience other parts of the world.</p>
      <p><strong>Right, tangent over.</strong></p>
      <p>So here I am, missing backpacking, wanting to talk about how this "vacation" I went on was so different, and not sure who to talk to about it.  Assuming I did have someone though, I realize I can't.</p>
      <blockquote>Whenever I tried to talk about backpacking with anyone, I become incredibly self conscious.</blockquote>
      <p>I don't want to be that person who goes, "Oh, this one time, <em>when I was hiking Mount Doom in New Zealand...</em>(which I didn't actully do btw, need to go back).</p>
      <p>When I talk about living in London, I'm worried I'll come off as arogent as well.  "I was on <em>the tube</em> once coming back from a night out, and was <em>really fancying a curry</em> so..." </p>
      <p>Getting back from traveling, adjusting to life in Atlanta, I thought about writting an after-backpacking blog post here.  I even started writting one. Three separate times.  None of those posts felt right. Maybe I hadn't been back long enough to digest all the expereinces I had along side the new changes in my life.</p>
      <p>Here I am, a year and three months after being back in Atlanta, trying again. In a sense, this feels ridiculous to write now, because me-today feels completely unconnected to backpacking-me.  But that's one reason why I want to write this, to remember that me, and see how she is still a part of my life. So... here I go.</p>
