        <p>Way back in the precendented times of 2017, I centered my statement of purpose for an application to Georgia Tech's Online Masters of Compuer Science program around the ability of remote technology to attack the lack of opportunities accessible to people who don't live in London, San Fransisco, New York, or Hong Kong.</p>
        <p>Fast forward to 2020, where remote working is a way of life and I'm only a few classes from graduating Georgia Tech's online masters program, my statement of purpose seems even more relevant than when I wrote it.</p>
        <p>The thoughts aren't unique, and that statement below is heavily edited from the orginal essay, but enjoy some insight into my thoughts!</p>

        <strong> “If you don’t leave here, you will never be nothing,”</strong> Ken yelled at Rick when Rick took a job on his home island, Flores, Indonesia.
        </p>
        <p>
        Rick was my tour guide while visiting Flores, Indonesia. Ken is his brother. The remote location of Flores leads to limited opportunities, which Ken sees as an insurmountable problem, the only solution being to uproot their lives and physically move. This problem though, does not have to be insurmountable.

        <strong>Better transition</strong>
        <p>
         Take for instance, offline and online functionality of apps. What are the best ways to optimize delivery of content across poor connections? What is the best experience for an individual using an app where wifi is unreliable, cutting out unpredictably every few hours?

        I want to work with creative teams who propose unapologetically innovative ideas, like using robotic surrogates to educate children in third world countries on malnutrition.
        </p>
        <p>
        I want to use my technical knowledge to either help these ideas become reality, or know enough to interview and hire a team who can.
        </p>
        <p>
        Working in a corporation with the right resources and mission, I want to steer a department in a direction that is good for the corporation, good for the consumer, and good for the world.  Think, for instance, of the wifi enabled hair brushes previewed at the Consumer Electronics Show this past year. While at first glance, this product seems ridiculous and superfluous, imagine a company like Dove sponsoring this product. With one developed version of the product, they could offer suggestions for hair care products. With another version, they could check for and help prevent lice outbreaks in third world countries.

        Building my academic expertise around topics such as network and performance concerns, and shaping my career goals around innovative and impactful development will help me identify and fix problems technology can help solve, such as the disparity of opportunities based on physical location.

        One of the most beautiful roles technology can have in someone’s life is to act as an enabler – an enabler to learning, an enabler to social interactions, and an enabler to being your best self, regardless of age, socio-economic class, or physical location.

            With the increased focus on remote working in 2020, people are actively focusing on the improvement of remote technology.
            After the corona virus is under control and fewer people are working from home however, we need to continue investing heavily in remote technology.
