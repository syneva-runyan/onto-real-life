        For some reason there&#8217;s this fear people have of going out and
        doing things alone. It brings an uncomfortable feeling, like putting a
        left shoe on a right foot or expecting another stair step and hitting
        flat ground. Traveling alone for work however means solo dinners &#8211;
        and when you have a per-diem to spend, eating take out or at an
        in-and-out place every night is a waste.

        {" "}Usually these meals go by without a hitch, because, believe it or
        not, a solo eater isn&#8217;t nearly as interesting people watching as,
        say, the maybe-guy-maybe-girl-over-tatooed-rayband-wearing-Barista
        possibly hitting on your friend. Unless of course you happen to be all
        of those things PLUS have a tiny white dog on a red bejeweled leash. In
        that case, then yes, everyone will look at you and judge, your case is
        hopeless.

        The one exception to this rule is the waiter or waitress, whose job it
        is to notice everyone. If they are professional, they should not
        question or judge their guests. Unfortunately, some people lack the
        ability to withhold judgement. These are the same people who honk at the
        old lady with a cane who just had double knee surgery that taking{" "}

        Last week in Toronto, I went to a rooftop restaurant, asked for a table
        for one, and was seated. Fifteen minutes later, someone comes up to my
        table and says &#8211;
      </p>
      <p>
        &#8220;I know you&#8217;re still waiting on a friend, but would you like
        to get a drink?&#8221;
      </p>
      <p>
        When I responded with an &#8220;Actually, I&#8217;m eating
        alone&#8230;&#8221;
      </p>
      <p class="quote">
        The waitress very awkwardly laughed and was like &#8220;Ah that&#8217;s
        &#8230; that happens&#8221;
      </p>
      <p>
        EXCUSE YOU BUT I SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO EAT ALONE WITHOUT BEING JUDGED.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because of instances like this, I will continue to semi-comfortably eat
        alone at nice restaurants, telling myself I&#8217;m not interesting
        enough to watch or notice, but looking down at my shoes every once in
        awhile to check and make sure I didn&#8217;t screw up my left and
        right&#8230; because <bold>SOMETHING</bold> feels slightly off.
