          A few days before a weekend trip, I think about packing&#8230;. I could
          just shout out in my living room, &#8220;Hey Alexa, what&#8217;s the
          weather like in ______&#8221; and start planning my outfits ahead of
          time. It&#8217;d be a one-time ten minute job to write a to-pack list
          for all my trips: phone charger, cell phone, passport, etc&#8230;
        </p>
        <p>
          Instead, come night before, or more often, morning of, that is when I
          haphazardly throw a random assortment of
          what-I-think-is-weather-appropriate-clothing, and everything off the
          nonexistent packing list that I can remember &#8211; usually minus a few
          things.
        </p>
        <p>
          Compound that haphazardous packing with alcohol &#8211; you can start to
          imagine how inadequate my luggage was for Barcelona. Poor packing was
          epitomised by shoe choice &#8211; Nude ballet flats. They didn&#8217;t
          require any socks (always have a hard time finding matching pairs), and
          in drunken-theory, they work for both casual touristing and for
          going-out. You know what ballet flats don&#8217;t work well for? Hiking.
          Specifically, four hours of mountain hiking.

          An hour&#8217;s train ride outside of Barcelona is the breath taking
          town of Montserrat. Montserrat is hidden between imposing rocks that
          jutt straight out from the ground. Interestingly, these rocks were made
          over millions of years (maybe exaggerating here, but we&#8217;re talking
          rocks so it&#8217;s entirely possible) from sediment collected in an
          ancient sea, which eventually dried up. A bizzillion years later (all
          time estimates made up), tectonic movements pushed up the pressurized
          sedimentary remains into the beauty that you see above.
        </p>
        <p>
          There&#8217;s a monastery in Montserrat (that&#8217;s about all that
          there is) famous for attracting religious pilgrims, including several
          popes over the years. Many people come to see the Black Mother. Along
          with St. George, she is the patron Saint of Catalonia. Pro tip: you can
          either wait in an hour plus line to get up close and look at her for two
          seconds before being shuffled on, <em>or</em>, you can bring a good zoom
          lesson, walk into the main church (zero wait), and get almost the same
          view. Well maybe not the same, but hey, there&#8217;s an hour of my life
          right there saved&#8230;

        </p>
        <p>
          Outside the monastery, there&#8217;s the beautiful hiking. Beautiful
          rocks, beautiful trails, beautiful views. You turn a corner, and BAM.

          My dad has a phrase &#8211; &#8220;If you&#8217;re gonna be stupid, you
          gotta be tough.&#8221; So here I was, in nude ballet flats, hiking two
          hours up to a gorgeous view.

          I&#8217;m only half crazy though, so decided to take the short route
          down &#8211; half an hour shaved off with a tram ride. It turns out you
          can only buy two way tram tickets though. And only at the bottom, not
          top. So being ticketless, I had to skip the tram and finish the hike.
          What was supposed to the be the &#8220;short route&#8221; added an extra
          40 minutes. It gave me a chance to double-prove my toughness though,
          right? Freaking ballet flats&#8230;

          For the actual Barcelona part of the trip &#8211; my feet were dead. As
          any good tourist knows, touristing requires a lot of walking. Luckily
          there happened to be a cheap Asian variety market next to the air bnb we
          stayed at &#8211; Probably a 4 on the sketch level, so really not that
          bad. Come Saturday morning &#8211; I became the proud owner of a
          wonderful pair of snocks &#8211; Sneaker/Croc. Name courtesy Daniel
          Barfield. They&#8217;re amazing shoes, highly recommend.

          We spent alot of time walking around the Barcelona, exploring random
          streets and hills, and working on an awesome hilltop photoshoot.

          Barcelona day two was done via a little yellow car &#8211; also highly
          recommend. The car came with a gps guided tour, and apart from one or
          two (or ten) wrong turns and loop abouts, the little yellow car let us
          see most of the main sites efficiently.
        </p>
        <p>
          Asian tourists took pictures of us at one point and I gave them a
          sarcastic smile and a thumbs up &#8211; I will forever live in their
          vacation memories!

          And of course, no trip to Barcelona is complete without seeing La
          Sagrada Familia. We bought tickets for the morning of the last day
          &#8211; or we thought we had. Turns out the tikcets were for the
          previous day -opps. Terrible UX on the website &#8211; maintain it
          wasn&#8217;t our fault.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sagrada Familia blew me away. I had heard how beautiful it was and blah
          blah blah &#8211; but the sheer size of building &#8211; the way the sun
          streamed perfectly through the stain glass &#8211; the obvious care and
          love that was put into every. single. apect. of the church&#8217;s
          design. I literly just &#8211; can&#8217;t.

        <p>You can not go to Barcelona without visiting that church.</p>
        <p>Barcelona was an amazing city to visit.</p>
        <p>
          People were happy there and smiled. Culturally, there was a strong sense
          of identify. Having beaches, mountains, and city scapes all within an
          hour of each other &#8211; that&#8217;s amazing.
        </p>
        <p>
          As far as living there &#8211; economically, Spain is going through some
          harder times, and there aren&#8217;t many good opportunities in
          Barcelona for young people. As my friend Summit pointed out though
          &#8211; there were a lot of retired people living very happily with
          energetic &amp; friendly dogs in the city. Maybe one day that&#8217;ll
          be me.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is so much I didn&#8217;t have a chance to see in Barcelona.
          I&#8217;ll be back again, this time with real shoes. Sunscreen and
          weather appropriate clothes would be preferable to have as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>PS: </strong>Other highlights of the trip included:
        </p>
        <p>
          + <strong>Patatas Bravas</strong>: May or may not have ordered these
          with every single meal. And by order I mean my friend ordered them and I
          muched.
        </p>
        <p>
          + <strong>Chupitos</strong>: I&#8217;d been hearing about this shot bar
          for 5 years, literally. Order a friend the Monica Lewinsky. If you order
          a Georgia, you get your thumb set on fire, which is fun too.
        </p>
        <p>
          + <strong>Gaudi everything</strong>. Barcelona has amazing architecture.
          Explore it!
        </p>
        <p>
          + <strong>Good, cheap food</strong>. Kebabs, bocadillas, and again,
          patatas bravas.
        </p>
        <p>
          + <strong>Friends: </strong>It was great to go with such a good group of
          people. Thanks Summit, Daniel, and Brian 🙂
