        <strong>Q. What is the 48 hour rule?</strong></br>
        <p class="quote">Every 48 hours, somebody is going to mention Donald Trump.</p>
        I think Mark, one of the British guys I traveled with on the North island, was the first person to point this out.  A month later, the rule has yet to be broken.
        I've become less and less amused by this conversation.  Canned response now is to make a face and change the topic.

        It's really easy to meet other people at hostels.
        <p>I traveled with two British guys on the North Island for ~2 weeks, and got to meet up with both of them in different places later for a few days.  I met some really cool girls from Auckland in Nelson, a French Canadian I've met up with in different places twice now...
        There have also been a lot of cool people I've done stuff with just for a day or evening who I've really enjoyed spending time with.</p>
       <p> Not everyone wants to be friendly.  There was an American girl my age in Napier I met on the 4th of July who had also quit her job, was traveling alone for several months, and was also going to Indonesia in a few weeks who wasn't intereted in talking.
        <em>Not at all bitter about that... no bitterness... whatsoever.</em>  That's fine too though, I really enjoy taking time to myself every once in awhile, and 600 pages in, the book I'm reading is finally getting interesting.</p>
        There are also A LOT of British people because of a series of rugby games going on atm <em>(British and Irish Lions v. the New Zealand All Blacks)</em>. <em>Wait... I thought I left England?</em>
        No exaggeration, like half of the people I've met traveling have been British.  Having lived in London gives me something to start talking with them about, although I usually try to steer the conversation to something more interesting afterwards.

     <li><strong>Q. Why do I have a stick in the back of my car?</strong></br>
    I went to change my shoes before a hike in Nelson, sat down on my back bumper, set my keys on the trunk floor, threw my other shoes in the back, andddd.... slammed the trunk shut with my keys still inside.</br></br>
    I opened the back seat's cupholder, knocked off the backing, and shined my flash light in.  The keys were too far away from me to reach, so I walked around looking for a stick <em>(ignoring the strangers giving me weird looks).</em>
    I was just able to hook the stick onto my keys and save me the $150 AAA fee.</br></br>
    Since then I've kept a stick in my car justtt in case.

        <strong>Q. Has traveling alone as a girl made you feel unsafe?</strong></br>
        I've been in one or two situations where guys have made me feel uncomfortable.  Also found myself in a stairwell at one point with two clearly high middleaged men offering me a pinch of whatever they were taking.  <em>(atleast they were friendly though?).</em></br></br>
        For the most part though, New Zealand is safe, and if there is ever something I want to do that it wouldn't be smart to do alone (eg, nighttime walks) I find someone to do whatever it is with me.</br></br>
        I'm a little apprehensive about Indonesia, but I'm planning on meeting people along the way, and in general just avoiding dumb situations.

        <strong>Q. How's cooking going?</strong></br>
        I'm terrible at cooking.  Like, I've started a kitchen fires, and I burn nachos level of terrible.</br>
        Eating out in New Zealand is so freaking expensive though, and frankly, I didn't think it was possible, but I'm tired of eating fries.  They don't even taste good anymore, but I still keep on ordering them. So. Many. Burgers. And. Fries.</br></br>
        <strong>Good news:</strong> I haven't starved to death yet.</br>
        <strong>Bad news:</strong> I've been spending way too much money eating out.</br></br>
        <p class="quote">Cooking is still a work in progress, but I did manage to make some spaghetti for dinner earlier this week.</p>
        Pathetically, yes I'm proud of that.  Baby steps.  Will report back on progress later.

        I'm not sure why I find this so funny, but if you ever meet someone from Swindon, England, ask them about roundabouts. <em>(Thanks Henry and Mark for this)</em>
