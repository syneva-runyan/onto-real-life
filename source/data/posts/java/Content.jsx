      <p>Late last year, my dad left home early on a crisp fall morning.  He was driving to the DMV to take a motorcycle license test.</p>
      <p>He wasn't having a midlife crisis.  He hadn't bought a jet black, macho-American Harley, and there was no patched-up leather jacket to go with said motorcycle.</p>
      <p>Instead, my dad was about to buy and drive at 150cc motor scooter around town.</p>
      <blockquote className="quote">That 150cc scooter became not the first, not the second, but the third motor scooter parked in our family's garage.</blockquote>

      <p>Needless to say, I have a decent amount of moped skills (<em>nbd, nbd</em>).  With designated scooter lanes on large streets and scooter-width margins on the side of jam-packed roads, Java was a perfect place to put these skills into practice.</p>
      <p>I've spend the last two weeks in Java very happily taking trains, planes, cars, and scooters around the island.  A visit to the island promises adventure.  The people are friendly, smiling unprompted at everyone.  Importantly for backpackers, the prices in Java have been cheap.  Finally, the tourism has been rewarding, if slightly disorganized and in need of change.</p>
      <br />
      <h3>People & Culture</h3>
      <blockquote className="quote">More than 90% of people in Java are Muslim.</blockquote>
      <p>Before coming to Java, this stat meant a few things to me.</p>

        <li><strong>It would be inappropriate for a woman (me) to wear shorts or have my shoulders uncovered.</strong> This is despite the 90 deg F (32 deg C) heat.<br /></li>
        <li><strong>Expect an early morning wake up call</strong> with the <a href="http://www.balaams-ass.com/alhaj/calltoprayer.htm" target="blank">call to prayer</a> anywhere between 4am - 6am.<br />
        </li>
        <li><strong>Western tourists stand out.</strong></li>
      </ol>
      <p>Once or twice a day, people asked to take pictures with me, a light skinned, blue eyed tourist.  This demographic of picture-takers ranged from whole families to middle school girls, to middle aged women.</p>
      <p>There are various explanations you can read about tourist snaps online.  My favorite explanation references Indonesia as one of the most active nations on social media, with users wanting to portray themselves with interesting or different groups of people.</p>
      <p>Everyone who did ask for a photo with me (with one exception) was very friendly, always smiling and always thanked me afterwards.  This friendliness is something to be expected from the people in Java.</p>
      <p>Java is a tourist island, so there will be people, especially taxi drivers (<em>Taxi: loose term for a range of car, scooter, and bike transport</em>) asking if you need or want something on almost every street corner.</p>
      <blockquote className="quote"> For the most part though, these people will respect a no, and will offer sincere help or directions if needed.</blockquote>

            <figcaption className="caption">Java has very friendly people and culture.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Beyond light chatting however, conversations with locals was hard.  I speak very little Bahasa Indonesia.</p>
      <p><em>My vocabulary consists of the words for <strong>thankyou</strong>, <strong>chicken</strong>, and <strong>caution/danger</strong>.</em></p>
      <p>While the majority of Javanese people speak basic English, anything beyond common phrases may not be understood, grammar is often spoken incorrectly, and the accent can be difficult to understand.  Consequently, I spent most of my time socializing with other travelers, rather than locals.</p>
      <p>In summary, the Javanese are predominately Musilim, extremely friendly, intrigued by Western tourists, and easy to communicate but difficult to talk with.</p>
      <h3>Cheap Travels</h3>
      <figure className="width--50 align-right margin--left sm-width--100">
        <ResponsiveImg

          imgRootPath={imgBasePath}
          imgPrefix="food"
        />
      </figure>
      <p>One of the best things about traveling in Indonesia is the cost.</p>
      <p>You can enjoy (delicious) meals from street vendors sometimes for less than $1usd, almost always under $5usd.</p>
      <p>Bintang, the cheap Indonesia pilsner, almost has a cult following among tourists and locals.</p>
      <p>You can even drink an affordable cup of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kopi_Luwak">world's most expensive coffee</a>.</p>
      <p>Sometimes going for as much as $30-$50usd per cup abroad, you can grab a mug of Luwak coffee in Java for under $2.50usd.  Want to know what justifies such a high cost?</p> 
      <br />
      <blockquote>The coffee's smooth flavor is attributed to partial digestion of coffee beans by a cat like animal, the Asian Palm Civet.  Coffee beans are fed to the civet before being collected from their feces for coffee.</blockquote>

      </figure>
      <p>For expenses such as taxis and attraction entrance tickets, tourists should expect to be up charged.  When taking a taxi, make sure to always agree on a price before getting into the car.</p>
      <p>Despite cheap costs in most places, there are several expenses that suprised me in Java, such as the western prices of cappuccinos I drank in Jakarta and the $75usd I paid for a jeep tour to Mt. Bromo.</p>
      <p>If you're interested in saving money, most attractions in Java such as Mt. Bromo and Ijen can be visited without tour guides, and basic black coffee or tea is a cheaper alternative to espresso based drinks.</p>
      <h3>Tourism</h3>

            <figcaption className="caption">I'd recommend skipping Jakarta and heading straight to Yogya.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>While not as touristy as Bali, Java has plenty of tourist attractions.</p>
      <p>With only a 30 day tourist visa, I decided to hit only the big-name places on the island, including Jakarta, Yogyakarta, Mt. Bromo/Ijen. Looking back, I could have happily skipped Jakarta, going straight to Yogyakarta (pronounce jogjakarta).</p>
      <p>Yogya is a fairly interesting city that comes with numerous day tripping option, the most popular ones including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Pramabana Complex:</strong> Unesco World heritage site with a collection of Hindu and Buddhist temples.</li>
        <li><strong>Borobudur:</strong> A large Buddhist temple celebrated for it's Nirvana sunrises.</li>
        <li><strong>Jomblang Cave:</strong> A cave famous for it's "Light from Heaven"</li>
        <li><strong>The Chicken Church:</strong> (<em>Ok so maybe not one of the most popular sites outside of Jogja, but one of my favorites</em>)</li>
      </ul>

            <figcaption className="caption">Among the day trip options outside of Yogyakarta are the Chicken Church (<em>Top left</em>), Jomblang Cave(<em>Top Right</em>), and Borobudur (<em>Bottom</em>)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>As a solo traveler, there are not many group tours you can join in on, so it's best to make friends with people in your hostel or hotel to split the cost of transport for day tours.</p>
      <p>Another option is to rent a scooter.  I paid $7usd a day to rent a scooter and go on a trip from Jogjakarta to the Pramabana Complex, to Borobudur, to Mareapi over three days.</p>
      <p>I had a blast driving around the beautiful country side.  I kept expecting the traffic to die down outside of the cities, but without fail, whenever I looked around, there was always at least one other scooter, if not five, in sight.</p>
      <blockquote>There are over ~141 million people living in Java, making it the most populous island in the world.</blockquote>
      <p>You will never escape traffic in Java.  While this makes some tourists worried about riding scooters, as long as you a) are always aware of your surroundings and b) don't perform any maneuvers or go faster than you're comfortable with anyone can ride a scooter safely through Java.</p>
      <p>With eight hour train ride away from Jogjakarta, you can get to the Mt. Bromo and Ijen areas.</p>
      <p>Mt. Bromo is in a national park with a collection of three active volcanos.  The collection promises surreal views, and visitors are able to hike to the edge of Mt. Bromo's crater and peer in.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Nearby Mt. Ijen is a volcano famous for blue flames you can see at dark inside it's crater.  These flames are a result of the combustion of Sulphur from inside the volcano when it comes in contact with oxygen.</p>
      <p>Early morning tours allow you (and hundreds of other tourists) to see the blue flames followed by an incredible sunrise for the crater's rim. Sunset tours are not officially available as the park closes with sundown.</p>

      <p>There is a general lack of credible information (if any information at all) online about tourist sites in Java.  The <em>Lonely Planet</em> book on Indonesia was a helpful and informative resource, and there are several blogs that I relied on heavily when planning what to do when. <a href="https://www.bemytravelmuse.com" target="blank">Be My Travel Muse</a> specifically has some really great articles.</p>
      <p>I've compiled some of the more specific details of my time in Java <a href="" target="blank">here</a> for anyone trying to plan and finding themself frustrated with the lack of good information elsewhere.</p>
      <p>Another aspect of Java tourism that disappointed me was the inaccessibility of cultural or historical context at tourist sites.</p>

        <figcaption className="caption">There are still active Hindu ceremonies preformed on Mt.

      <blockquote className="quote">My romantic notion of a spiritual time-before-westernization experience in Java died on arrival.</blockquote>
      <p>My first tour guide in Jakarta answered most of my questions with "I don't know"s and even told us at the end of the day that he didn't like Jakarta.</p>
      <p>Despite reading online about the ongoing Hindu practices on Mt. Bromo, my tour guide provided commentary only on the scenery.</p>
      <p>Culturally, there was no connection between the sites I saw on Java and the people I met.</p>
      <p>This can be partially attributed to the rise of Islam on the island, starting in the 13th century and escalating to a large scale in the 16th. During this time period, a large number of Javanese Hindus and Buddhists fled to Bali.</p>
      <p>After this exodus, the cultural attachments to historical, famous landmarks and areas of Java faded.</p>
      <blockquote>Borobudur specifically was abandoned in the 14th century and completely forgotten until rediscovery by archeologists in the 19th century.</blockquote>

      <h4>Growth of Tourism</h4>
      <p>As of 2013, Indonesia was no longer <a href="http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2013/02/23/your-letters-no-longer-a-third-world-country.html" target="blank">categorized as a "Third World Country,"</a> and tourism played a large role in this development.</p>
      <blockquote>Indonesia drew 8.8m overseas visitors in 2013, according to the World Economic Forum, raising $9.1bn in tourism revenues.  <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/9869855e-fa4c-11e5-8f41-df5bda8beb40" target="blank">Source</a></blockquote>
      <p>As tourism grows across Java and Indonesia in general, aspects of this industry will have to change.</p>
      <figure className="width--50 align-left margin--right">
        <ResponsiveImg
          alt="Jomblang Cave Safety Standards"

      <p>The steps down to Ijen crater were becoming noticeably sleek from wear, with tourists keeping a slow pace to prevent themselves from falling down the rocks.</p>
      <p>Sunrise was so crowded at Borobudur that I couldn't find a seat on the spacious top most level.</p>
      <p><em>Two</em> girls waiting near me for sunrise at Mt. Bromo fainted from standing uncomfortably with locked knees in a crowd.</p>
      <p>The "safety guidelines" on my trip to Jomblang cave were loose.  Not so loose that I thought I would die, but I'm surprised someone hasn't been injured before (as far as I know).</p>
      <p>As the country continues to develop it's tourism, conservation efforts will need to increase, and safety standards improved.  If not, the beautiful sites in Java will be ruined and tourists will face dangers, becoming injured at higher and higher rates.</p>
      <hr />
      <p>Two weeks on the island felt more like two months.  The people & culture, the cheap prices, and the tourism, are worlds away from Western experiences.  Despite the differences, I managed to feel at home riding around on scooters, and chilling in coffee shops and hostel common rooms. The challenging yet positive experiences of traveling in Java make the island a must for anyone traveling to Indonesia in search of adventure.</p>
