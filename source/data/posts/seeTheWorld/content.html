        className= Travel is fatal to prejudice, bigotry, and narrow-mindedness,
        and many of our people need it sorely on these accounts. Broad,
        wholesome, charitable views of men and things cannot be acquired by
        vegetating in one little corner of the earth all oneâ€™s lifetime.{" "}

      <p>There are plenty of practical things to spend money.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          A house (no white picket fence though, never understood the appeal)
        </li>
        <li>
          Unforgettable weekends binges (pinnacling at free shots for the entire
          bar and crash landing at 4am in a Waffle House)
        </li>
        <li>
          A fanzy car the rapper-next-door gives a low whistle at every time you
          drive by
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I&#8217;m confident that in another 10 years or so, all of these things
        will come to me (except the rapper next door, willing to admit that
        migghtttt be a stretch). And if they don&#8217;t? I&#8217;ll find
        equally practical things to fill those voids. For now though, my main
        spending outlet will be travel.

        There are a million excuses that, if you&#8217;re not careful, will
        impede travel plans. I could list them, but everyone is familiar with
        the common themes. Money, time, worries of lonliness, etc. The value of
        travel experiences though surpass all concerns.

        The first time I left the US, I was shocked at how similar people of
        different cultures were to me, even when they were drastically
        different. This fact is epitomised in a story I heard on{" "}
        <em>Modern Love.</em> A social worker in Philadelphia was tasked with
        counseling a group of Syrian refugee women. These women had stared into
        the face of starvation, had seen their cities and homes destroyed, had
        lost loved ones to war. The social worker worried. How could she begin
        to comprehend what these women had experienced and provide them help?
        When the women came to talk to her however, what did they have to say?
        They complained about their husbands being lazy, or the boy they who
        maybe-kinda-liked them.

        Love &#8211; and love problems &#8211; are so universal. It is one of
        the many human emotions that traverses all cultural borders, that makes
        people relatable everywhere you go.

        I want to understand the belief systems and lifestyles of people around
        the world. I want to see people who live differently than me, and know
        that it&#8217;s ok. I want to meet people living a completely different
        lives than me, and find aspects of their lives relatable.
      </p>
      <p>
        I want to kill my prejudice, bigotry, and narrow-mindedness while
        I&#8217;m still young. The house, the binges, and the sweet ass car can
        wait.
