      <p>I landed back in Atlanta after taking six months off to travel on a Thursday, and re-started my full time job the following Monday.</p>
      <p>In the next two months, I searched for and found a new apartment. I furnished that apartment (I didn't own so much as a decent bath towel).
        Unhappy with my current job, I started looking for a new job.  I started hanging out more and more with my friend Kyle (who later became my boyfriend).
        I did my best to reconnect with friends I hadn't seen in the two years since I left for London.
      </p>
      <p>
        Within three months, I started grad school part time, and took a consulting job that had me traveling weekly to Chicago.

      <blockquote>
        Needless to say, I was overwhelmed with the number of changes in my life.
      </blockquote>
      <p>Six months into life back home, I went on a family vacation, something my family of 7 hadn't attempted in over a decade. The differences between that trip and the six months I spent backpacking were stark.  The most obvious difference: there wasn't nearly enough time to learn much about or get a deep feel for where were vacationing. I did <em>learn,</em> and I did <em>get a feel</em> for the place, it just wasn't the same.</p>
      <p>I really wanted to talk to someone in person about how different those experiences were, but none of the people I met traveling, who could relate directly to me, were in Atlanta.</p>
      <p>Assuming I did find another friend to listen, I realize I didn't know how talk about it.</p>
      <blockquote>Whenever I try to talk about backpacking with anyone, I become incredibly self-conscious.</blockquote>

      <p>I don't want to be that person who goes, "Oh, this one time, <em>when I was hiking Mount Doom in New Zealand...</em>(which I didn't actually do btw).</p>
      <p>When I talk about living in London, I'm worried I'll come off as arrogant as well.  "I was on <em>the tube</em> once coming back from a night out, and was <em>really fancying an indian</em> so..." </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P59zg43WGYA" target="blank">This youtube video</a> captures my worst nightmare of who I might be.</p>
      <p>Getting back from traveling, adjusting to life in Atlanta, I thought about writing an after-backpacking blog post.  I even started writing one. Three separate times.  None of those posts felt right. Maybe I hadn't been back long enough to digest all the experiences along side the new changes in my life.</p>
      <p>So here I am, a year and three months after being back in Atlanta, trying again. In a sense, this feels ridiculous to write now.  Me-today feels completely unconnected to backpacking-me - but that's one reason why I want to write this, to remember that me, and see how she is still a part of my life (corny as it sounds).</p>
      <p>Below are some of my thoughts on how, even over a year disconnected from backpacking, I still carry that experience with me.</p>
      <h4>Meeting People</h4>
      <figure className="width--50 sm-width--50 margin--left align-right">
        <ResponsiveImg
          alt="Tour Group in Australia"
          imgRootPath={imgBasePath}
          imgPrefix="group"  
        />
        <figcaption className="caption">
          Just a few of the amazing people I met traveling.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Americans have a bad reputation for asking "So, what do you do?" when meeting people.  I'm still incredibly guilty of this, but very rarely does that question lead to any deep or exciting conversation.</p>
      <p>Talking from a personal perspective, I don't like talking about being a web developer to strangers.  49/50 times they're not going to relate to what I do, and I can see the polite-yet-unengaged smile plastered on their face when I talk about it, and want to cringe for them.</p>
      <p>Organically growing a conversation from whatever situation you're in or asking about hobbies <em>(Even if it's Netflixing, people have bizarre/interesting theories on shows they'll tell you about if you ask)</em> is so much exciting than taking about work.</p>
      <p>You don't need to go traveling to learn this, but it's something I learned while traveling.  I don't always like meeting new people, but backpacking-solo meant new conversations and new people almost every day. Having the <em>same conversation</em> about work, where you're from, etc, gets really old, really quickly. It's important to rush through all that and get to everything, anything more interesting.</p>
      <h4>Finding What Makes You Happy</h4>
      <figure className="width--25 sm-width--50 margin--right align-left">
        <ResponsiveImg
          alt="ripple on a lake in front of a mountain"
          imgRootPath={imgBasePath}
          imgPrefix="ripple"

        <figcaption className="caption">
          I love taking pictures.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>"Traveling" is such an easy answer to the "What Makes You Happy," question, but for me at least, there are <em>aspects</em> of traveling that I love, that I seek out at home.</p>
      <p>Photography is a great example.  It's something I've always loved doing, but having so many things to photograph traveling, I realized just how much I loved it - the actual process of seeing a composition in your head, or recognizing beautiful light, and being able to capture it.</p>
      <p>I'll never be a professional photographer, but sometimes on weekends or evenings, I'll bring my camera to somewhere I've been wanting to take pictures, and take some shots.<em>(Shots, shots, shots, shots, shots)</em></p><br/>
      <blockquote>Almost more than travling, I like <em>expereincing new things.</em></blockquote>
      <p>Sure, I want to hike to Manchu Pichu still, but that Doll's Head Train in South Atlanta was one of the creepiest hikes I've ever been on...</p>
      <figure className="width--70 align-center margin--bottom">

        <figcaption className="caption">

      </figure>
      <p>Finally, I realized I love learning new things and attacking my own ignorance.  Traveling makes this easy, you're constantly exposed to different ways people live their lives, and you're constantly learning about whatever country or culture you're in - but I can still do this now, from home.</p>
      <p>If I meet someone from a place I haven't been to, I'll ask them about their life.  If I'm friends with an ancient Mesopotamian & Greek history major <em>(True story, I met one the other day)</em> - You bet I'll want to talk to them about Mespotamia and Greece. Sometimes I'll even pick up books or watch documentaries, or research my family's involvement in history <em>(Turns out I have a pretty boring family history.  You wouldn't guess based on how awesome we are now ;) )</em> to learn more about whatever I don't know about.</p>
      <p>All of these things make me happy. I experienced them to an extreme while traveling, but I keep up with them in my day-to-day life at home.</p>
      <h4>It's OK to Take Days Off</h4>
      <figure className="width--25 sm-width--50 align-left margin--right">
        <ResponsiveImg
          alt="Me. Done with people"
          imgRootPath={imgBasePath}
          imgPrefix="dontTalkToMe"  
        />
        <figcaption className="caption">

      <p>This one is pretty self explanatory.  When you're traveling, you're around new things and new opportunities are constantly there, and it's important to have a "yes" mentality about things. But it is also SOOOO important to give yourself time off.  The same applies in life.</p>
      <p>At least once a month traveling, I would get a private hostel room, or find a cafe to sit alone in for a few hours ("cafe" being a loose term in some countries...) with a book, my laptop, or blank postcards waiting for me to write and send them.</p>
      <p>I have a tendency to over think everything, to over react to situations, I feel a compulsion <em>to be doing something always.</em> </p>
      <p>Not just metaphorically, but literally giving myself time and space to breathe is something I'm working on.</p>
      <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> If you know me and see me in public without makeup, looking as tired as I do in that picture, I probably don't want to talk to you. Not you personally, but anyone.</p>
      <h4>Life is Always Going to Be Hard</h4>
      <p>No matter at what part of your life you're in, there are going to be challenges.  Some times or situations may be harder than others, but</p>
      <blockquote>
        show me someone who has a perfect life, who is always happy, who doesn't have problems, and I'll... I don't know what I'll do for you, but I might die of shock and disbelief.
      </blockquote>
      <p>There were days traveling when I'd look for the cheapest and quickest plane ticket home, and consider buying it.  There was always something or someone to keep me going though.</p>
      <p>Some of the happiest people I met in other countries were the ones who didn't have much, but were always willing to share their food or company with complete strangers.</p>
      <p>When we're unhappy, or we're going through a difficult time, as hard as it can be to do, it's important to remember and be thankful for good things in your life, take small steps to improve your situation, or to fill your life with better things. That leads perfectly to my last thought...</p>
      <h4>The Value of a Support Network</h4>
      <figure className="width--25 sm-width--50 align-right margin--left">
        <ResponsiveImg
          alt="Ponce City Market"
          imgRootPath={imgBasePath}
          imgPrefix="pcm"  
        />
        <figcaption className="caption">

        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>It took me a few months to make it, but one of the primary reasons I decided not to look for a new job back in London, or up and move out of Atlanta, is because of the support network I have here - Friends, family, familiar faces in random places...</p>
      <p>I love all of the friends I met when living in London, and everyone I met traveling impacted my experiences, and therefor my life in different, positive ways. There's something about coming home to people who are obligated to love me no matter what (thanks fam) that is comforting.</p>
      <p>Not having to meet new people every day, being able to call up someone whenever I'm having a rough day and want to grab a drink... Those are some of the things I really missed when I was away from home.</p>
      <p>I'm pretty bad about keeping up with most people.  Social media is great, but I'd 5000x prefer to catch up with someone in person than just on the phone, by text, or via a one-to-many post.</p>
      <p>Being back in the city where I know more people than anywhere else is important to my life right now.  Maybe in another few years I'll be ready to move again, but just at this moment, I think I'm in the right place for me.</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>Alright.  Lots of thoughts about me, thanks for hanging in, and I hope you all can relate to some of them. I learned a lot about myself in a small amount of time when I was traveling.  I haven't "changed," and I probably didn't need to travel all the way around to learn everything that I did.  But I'm so grateful for the education and experiences that I was afforded.  Now that I've been back awhile and am (slightly) more settled, even though I am disconnected from the backpacking, always-slightly-sunburned-but-never-tan, less-so-but-still-pretty-shy-but-amicable self, maybe I can start talking to people more about traveling and my experiences abroad.  Not in a, "OMG this one time <em>when I was on the tuuubbbeeee,</em> kinda way. More so in a "I learned this about myself because of xyz experience I had" kind of way. Or maybe even in a "I once rode a scooter off the road into a mudtrap, and was rescued by a shirtless British guy in the middle of a rainstorm" <em>(hugely exaggerated, but true story)</em> type of fun story.</p>
