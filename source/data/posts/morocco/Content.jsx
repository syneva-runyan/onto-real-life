        Morocco was a shock, but in a life-lessons, enlightening kind of way.
        Very little could have prepared me for the culture, maze-like Medinas,
        lawless (but heavily policed) roads, and exotic wildlife there.
      </p>
      <h3>CULTURE</h3>
      <p>
        Islam was introduced to Morocco with an Arab invasion in 680 AD. Nearly
        99% of the population practice Islam today (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_by_country">
          possibly legit source
        </a>).

        The call to prayer at 5am sunrises, the fact that some men weren’t
        allowed to shake my hand (since I ‘m a woman) were new to me. In the
        first city we visited, Chefchaouen , we weren’t able to get a glass of
        wine with dinner anywhere inside the Medina – devastating after a long
        day of stressful travel. (Just kidding, I wasn’t actually devastated. Or
        was I…)
      </p>
      <p>
        Medinas were new to me too. Medinas are small, fortified, North African
        communities that have several of the following: Mosques, fountains,
        bakeries, narrow winding street markets called souks…

        Medinas aren’t designed with urban living as their primary focus – they
        cater to a religious life style, with mosques and other religious
        buildings playing a central role in their communities.

        Of all the cultural differences, the attitude of opportunistic salesmen
        was the most exhausting.

        We learned very quickly that <strong>
          EVERYTHING WAS A TRAP.
        </strong>{" "}
        This included the seemingly nice guy offering to lead us to our hostel
        when we were lost. He proceeded to lead us around in circles before
        demanding money. The traps included the friendly server at breakfast who
        recommended a Berber rug shop, where his friend, the owner, promised us
        we wouldn’t be pressured into buy things… and then sat us, gave us tea,
        and pressured us into buying things. Even the ‘official’ tour guide
        recommended to us in Fez told us very little of the city’s history,
        focusing more of our attention toward the artisan good shops, where we
        were pressured into buying things. We learned how to say “La shukraan”
        (no thankyou) before the end of the first day in Morroco, and as the
        week progressed, our <em>la</em>s became more and more forceful.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>CITIES</h3>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          Once recovering from the initial culture shock (and upgrading our
          level of <em>la shurkaan</em>s) I started to enjoy more of the souks.
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        I was able to appreciate the subtle (or not so subtle) differences
        between Chefchaouen, Fez, and Marrakesh.

        Fez felt the most “authentic”. The Medina’s streets were half the width
        of those in Marrakesh. There were far fewer tourists. The whole city has
        been declared a world heritage site, and the white walls and cultural
        buildings were impressively well maintained.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the past few years, the US and other UN countries have been
        contributing money towards the restoration of certain areas.
        Specifically, a canal that runs through the heart of the Media is being
        rebuilt. I’d love to come back in a few years and see the empty waterway
        gushing with water and the scaffolding cleared from the beautiful
        building facades.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the same time, I wonder how much the city will be changed by the
        expected influx of tourists. Will the authentic Arabic culture become
        more westernized, more similar to how Marrakesh has developed? The
        people I met in Fez seem to cherish their culture heavily, but
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>95% of the city works in artisan trades.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        The success of these businesses are tied closely to the success of
        tourism. Will this dependency on tourism dictate changes in culture?

        Marrakesh was the most Western of the cities we visited. It’s further
        south than both Chefchaouen and Fez, and has more Berber influence than
        Arabic in comparison to the northern cities. (Berbers being native
        nomads of the Sahara dessert) There is even a European market in
        Marrakesh, where all of the artisan shops have fixed prices, no haggling
        needed or allowed.

        Not to disappoint, there were still plenty of opportunities to be ripped
        off or misguided by shop keepers and street workers.

        ready for was the guy who walked up to me, put a snake around my neck,
        tried to take my camera from me for a picture. He refused to take the
        snake off my neck when I said no. I paid him money to leave me alone.
        The picture of the cobra isn&#8217;t even that great.

      <h3>WILDLIFE</h3>
      <p>
        Other wild life of Morocco contribute to successful businesses as well.
        Wild monkeys, camels, and tree goats were some of my favorite parts of
        the trip.
      </p>
      <p>
        On our drive south from Fez, we stopped by a park with the hope of
        seeing the monkeys. After a good amount of time searching, we
        regretfully turned back. A dropped pair of brand name eye glasses in the
        woods did offer circumstantial evidence that the monkeys existed and
        were mischievous however. Sulking in the car, I silently and mournfully
        reconciled with the fact that I wouldn&#8217;t be able to pet baby
        monkeys – but I gave up hope too soon!
      </p>
      <p>
        Fifteen minutes down the road, we saw a family of monkeys chilling on
        the side of the road! Us and a handful of other cars stopped to take
        pictures.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          There were men selling peanuts to give the monkeys, but for ethical
          reasons, we decided not to feed them.

        Tree goats are another road side attraction in Morocco. On the road from
        Marrakesh to Essouria, there are fields full of argan tress and goats.
        The goats sometimes eat the nuts that grown on these trees, not letting
        the inconvenience of skinny branches or height get to them. I read
        online that sometimes tree goat scene are staged.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          Farmers will take their goats and tie their legs in tree specifically
          to attract tourists.
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Because of this, when we saw the tree goats with the suspicious looking
        farmers sitting near by, we opted not to stop the car for photos. We did
        a slow drive by, getting the following sketchy-looking picture.
        Thankfully, there were no ropes in sight. We therefor deemed these
        ”natural” tree goats.

        Most famous among all the animals in Morocco is the Camel. At sunset in
        Palm Grove outside of Marrakesh, we took an hour long camel ride. The
        pictures speak for themselves here. If we had more time, I&#8217;d loved
        to ride the camels in the dessert, across the sand dunes of the Sahara.
        That said – in the short ride I did take – my stomach did feel unsettled
        and I had light motion sickness. Any longer on the camel could have been
        a bad idea for me.

      <h3>DRIVING</h3>
      <p>
        The car we rented enabled us to see fifty times more of Morocco in a
        week than taking trains or buses would have. Because we had a car, we
        got to see monkeys &amp; checkout random rest stops with beautiful
        views. On the other hand, a guide in Marrakesh said that
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>People in Morocco “don’t drive. They avoid each other.”</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        That statement is accurate. There&#8217;s a cross walk 5 feet away – why
        unnecessarily waste the energy to cross there?
      </p>
      <p>
        We could have ran over children in the cities so many times. In the
        country, cars would pass on winding country roads, speeding past with
        little regard for safety or speed limits. There were also a lot of cop
        checkpoints in the country. Despite safe driving, we were ticketed
        twice, once for speeding and once for passing a tediously slow bus.
        Tickets had to be paid on the spot with cash. We didn’t ask what would
        have happened if we hadn’t had cash on us. Given paradoxical lack of law
        abiding drivers and multitude of cops, I have no idea how people in
        Morocco aren’t ticketed multiple times on a daily basis.

      <h3>Altogether</h3>
      <p>
        Morocco was an amazing country to visit. I’m glad I went with relatively
        little expectations. This allowed me to soak up the culture and
        experiences without much preconceived bias. There is so much I wasn’t
        able to fit into the week that I was there that I know I’ll have to go
        back for one day. Until then, I continuing spreading conspiracy theories
        about tree goats, fondly go back through my photos every once in awhile,
        and maybe start coming up with a real travel plan for my second visit 😊

      <h3>OTHER NOTES:</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Tannery</strong>: Fez is known as the &#8220;capital of
        leather.&#8221; We stopped at one on our tour. Entrance came with free
        “gas mask” for the smell (fresh mint leaves)
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Mint Tea</strong> – Fresh Mint tea is served with most meals and
        offered by salesmen in most shops.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Squatting toilets</strong> &#8211; Would encourage packing your
        own toilet paper and hand sanitizer if traveling around Morocco
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Ifran</strong> – A random city in Morocco designed to look and
        feel like a Swiss mountain village. Reportedly one of the cleanest
        cities in the world. Refreshing to stop through on a drive south from
        Fez, near the monkeys.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Essouria</strong> – Pretty seaside city. Markets here were more
        reasonably priced, and the Medina held it&#8217;s own charm. Game of
        Thrones shooting location.

        <strong>Dinner at the </strong>
        <strong>Governor&#8217;s</strong> &#8211; Sometimes the best experiences
        you have traveling are completely unplanned. I met up with my sister in
        Oarzazate, who was tagging along with a friend on a school trip, which
        was organized by the governor&#8217;s son. Very generous and friendly
        man and family.
