<p>This cataloge features some of the best walks I did on the north island, but is not comprehensive.</p>
<p>Map coming soon</p>
<h4>Rangitoto (Auckland)</h4>
<p>Rangitoto is a volcanic island with an easy hike up and around the crater.  There are lava caves worth exploring on the way up as well.</p>
<p>There's no open accomodation on the island, so would not recommend missing the last afternoon ferry.</p>

<h4>Waiheke (Auckland)</h4>
<p>Waiheke is one of the larger islands off the coast of Auckland.  On Waiheke there are beautiful, expensive house with beautiful, expansive views.  I went to Waiheke with the intention of drinking wine, which I did at various vinyards but I also managed to fit a nice hike in afterwards. One day wasn't enough time to see all of the island, and when I stop by on my way out of New Zealand, I'm excited to spend more time exploring here.</p>

<h4>Breams Head (Whangarai)</h4>
<p>Breams Head has been the most magestic hike of my trip so far.</p>
<p class="quote">At four hours, I chose the "short" trip. </br></br>Two hours of continous uphill are followed by windy bouldering to a breathtaking viewpoint, and then a muddy tramp back down the otherside of the mountain to an open bay.</p>

<h4>Mount Parahak (Whangarai)</h4>
<p>A 40 minute loop with spectacular panaromic views of Whangarai.  Was accompanied by a random chicken at the summit.</p>

<h4>Window Walk (Coromandel Peninsula)</h4>
<p>Located in the Coromandel Peninsula, this was the most beautiful and interesting walk I've done.</p>
<p>It features an old mine with hiking trails built ontop of old mine cart tracks, which weave in and out of a mountain face (<em>Bring a flashlight!</em>).  The "window walk" itself is only 20 minutes, but the area has a plethora of trails.</p>
<p>If you walk far enough and in the right direction you can make it to Owharoa Falls and<em> Falls retreat,</em> a cafe hidden in the woods with a warm heart, fairy lights, and delicious food.</p>

<h4>Tongarrio Crossing</h4>

<h4>Mount Victoria (Wellington)</h4>
<p>Calling this a "hike" is a bit of a stretch. There is a car park at the top for easy access if you're feeling lazy.</p>
<p>Short but steep uphill climb that ends in beautiful 360deg views.  Go during sunset <em>or sunrise if you're brave</em></p>
