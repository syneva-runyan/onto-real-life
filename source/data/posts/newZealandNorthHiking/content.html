<h4>Rangitoto</h4>
<p>Rangitoto is a volcanic island with an easy hike up and around the crater.  There are lava caves worth exploring on the way up as well.</p>
<p>There's no open accomodation on the island, so would not recommend missing the last afternoon ferry.</p>

<p>Wahike is one of the larger islands off the coast of Auckland.  On Wahike there are beautiful, expensive house with beautiful, expansive views.  I went to Wahike with the intention of drinking wine, which I did at various vinyards (<a href="#wine">see below</a>) but I also managed to fit a nice hike in afterwards. One day wasn't enough time to see all of the island, and when I stop by on my way out of New Zealand, I'm excited to spend more time exploring here.</p>

<h4>Breams Head</h4>
<p>Breams Head has been the most magestic hike of my trip so far.</p>
<p class="quote">At four hours, I chose the "short" trip. </br></br>Two hours of continous uphill are followed by windy bouldering to a breathtaking viewpoint, and then a muddy tramp back down the otherside of the mountain to an open bay.</p>

<p>Calling this a "hike" is a bit of a stretch, and there is also a car park </p>
