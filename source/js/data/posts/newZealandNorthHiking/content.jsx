        This catalog features some of the best walks I did on the north island,

      <h4>Rangitoto (Auckland)</h4>
      <p>
        Rangitoto is a volcanic island with an easy hike up and around the
        crater. There are lava caves worth exploring on the way up as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        There's no open accommodation on the island, so would not recommend
        missing the last afternoon ferry.
      </p>

      <h4>Waiheke (Auckland)</h4>
      <p>
        Waiheke is one of the larger islands off the coast of Auckland. On
        Waiheke there are beautiful, expensive house with beautiful, expansive
        views. I went to Waiheke with the intention of drinking wine, which I
        did at various vineyards but I also managed to fit a nice hike in
        afterwards. One day wasn't enough time to see all of the island, and
        when I stop by on my way out of New Zealand, I'm excited to spend more
        time exploring here.

      <h4>Breams Head (Whangarei)</h4>
      <p>Breams Head has been the most majestic hike of my trip so far.</p>
      <p className="quote">At four hours, I chose the "short" trip.</p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>
        Two hours of continuous uphill are followed by windy bouldering to a
        breathtaking viewpoint, and then a muddy tramp back down the other side
        of the mountain to an open bay.

      <h4>Mount Parahak (Whangarei)</h4>
      <p>
        A 40 minute loop with spectacular panoaomic views of Whangarei. Was
        accompanied by a random chicken at the summit.

      <h4>Whale Bay (Whangarei)</h4>
      <p>
        More of a short walk than a hike, but Whale Bay has some magnificent
        beaches and coast line. Worth the trip in the winter, but even better
        for a whole day of chilling in the summer.

      <h4>Window Walk (Coromandel Peninsula)</h4>
      <p>
        Located in the Coromandel Peninsula, this was the most beautiful and
        interesting walk I've done.
      </p>
      <p>
        It features an old mine with hiking trails built on top of cart tracks,
        which weave in and out of a mountain face (<em>Bring a flashlight!</em>).
        The "window walk" itself is only 20 minutes, but the area has a plethora
        of trails.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you walk far enough and in the right direction you can make it to
        Owharoa Falls and<em> Falls retreat,</em> a cafe hidden in the woods
        with a warm heart, fairy lights, and delicious food.
      </p>

      <h4>Geothermal wonderland (Rotorua)</h4>
      <p>
        A mostly paved, paid circuit around a geothermal park. Steam raises from
        everywhere in the ground and gets captured in spider webs, making a
        perfect setting for the next JJ Abrahms a science fiction horror film.

      <h4>Tongarrio Crossing (Taupo)</h4>
      <p>
        In this six hour hike, you'll see lava fields, craters, blueish green
        and reflective lakes, rolling hills, rushing water through the bush...
        For an added three hours, you can take a detour up Mt. Doom from Lord of
        the Rings, something I need to go back for.
      </p>
      <p>
        Guides are available, but unless you're a dog that needs a human to walk
        you, or you're going in the dead of winter, do it on your own.

      <h4>Huka Falls (Taupo)</h4>
      <p>
        A perfect cool-down walk after doing the Crossing. Water rushes through
        with a volume of 220,000 liters per second, also making it a perfect
        place to play Pooh sticks.
