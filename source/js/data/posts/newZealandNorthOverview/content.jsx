        My travels are broken down below by categories of{" "}
        <em>Things that made me want to go to New Zealand:</em> cities, wine,
        culture, outdoor activities, and Lord of the Rings (Yes, I'm a nerd)
        followed some short miscellaneous thoughts.
      </p>
      <h3>"Cities"</h3>
      <p>
        You know that stat about there being more sheep in New Zealand than
        people? Completely accurate. (<em>
          What do you call a town so small that there isn't even a pub?
        </em>)
      </p>
      <p>
        The few Kiwis that do exist however are very generous people, and they
        make fantastic coffee. Even the gas stations have manned (decent
        tasting) espresso machines. Gas station coffee tends to cost ~$4 nzd,
        which is cheaper than the usual $4.50 you pay for a cup everywhere else.
        If that seems expensive to you, it should.{" "}
        <bold>Everything is so expensive here.</bold> When you find a pint
        somewhere for $7.50 nzd, you stay at the pub. $7.50 is so much cheaper
        than the $10 you'll pay anywhere else.
      </p>
      <p>
        The cities I've visited though have been well worth the cost. Auckland,
        Whangarei, Napier, and Wellington are the ones big enough to taking note
        of.

        Best part of being in Auckland was the easy access to a series of
        islands off it's coast, including Waiheke, where you can spend a day
        drinking wine and hiking (see<a href="#wine"> wine</a> below).

        the city. Unless you want to be moving your car every 12 hours, either
        stay somewhere that offers parking, or leave your car outside the city
        and walk/bus in.

        New Zealand is famous for its wine, which tends to be light and sweet.
        Even people who don't like wine can appreciate the joy of spending a day
        walking or biking in the sun between wineries and enjoying fine wine for
        free or cheap.

        On the island of Waiheke outside of Auckland, I walked between
        vineyards, enjoying expansive views of sheep fields, pretending I could
        afford the housing there (<em>
          $600,000 nzd compared to national average of $447,272 nzd
        </em>).

        One of the vineyards, <em>Mudbrick</em> is owned by two accountants who,
        in their late twenties, said screw it, quit their jobs, and opened a
        winery. <em>Considering this as a future career model.</em>

        Napier and Hawkes Bay is another New Zealand region famous for wine
        (south east on North Island). There a handful of bike shops from which
        you can grab a map and spend an afternoon or full day biking along well
        maintained trails.

        These trails go along the coast, through sheep fields, and right past

        Years ago, a group of Polynesian natives noticed birds flying away every
        year in an unmapped direction. They decided to follow these birds, and
        lo-and-behold - they found New Zealand!
      </p>
      <p>
        The Maori (descendants of the Polynesian explorers) are well known for
        the Haka, or War Dance. It involves widening eyes, movement of the
        hands, and extrusion of the tongue. The idea is to become mentally and
        physically psyced before a battle and to terrify the enemy.
        <em>
          On a scale of would or would not intimidate me on the street, the Haka
          would win.

      <p>Facts I learned:</p>

        <li>
          The facial tattoos represent ancestry, accomplishments, and skills.
        </li>
        <li>
          While men get full facial tattoos, women's tattoos are restricted to
          their chins.
        </li>
        <li>
          Tattoos are carved into the skin with animal bones, rather than with
          ink inserted under the skin.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Maori used to eat the brains of their enemies as a sign of
          disrespect and an attempt to gain knowledge.
        </li>
        <li>
          You don't wear shoes inside a Marae (traditional gathering place)
          because the god of peace lives inside. The god of war rules the earth
          outside.{" "}
          <em>
            It's not best practice to track bits of war dirt into a peace zone.

        I could go on and on here, but won't. If you're interested, jump online
        and do some reading. You won't be disappointed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Something you won't find much information on online about is the theory
        that there were people living in New Zealand before the Maori.
        Suspiciously inline rocks across the country and sparse archelogical
        evidence on small offshore islands offer circumstantial evidence of
        this. Because of the land right battles and tension between European
        colonials and Maoris that claim historical rights, these theories are
        being swept under the carpet. (<em>Thanks Britain.</em>)

        Customs agents at the airport check for dirt on hiking shoes. I even

        up north, there were shoe cleaning stations at both the start and end.
        Like most islands, New Zealand has a unique, fragile ecosystem, and
        kiwis pride themselves on taking care of it. From Auckland onwards,

        Driving north from Auckland, I booked an airbnb hut for my four night

        a gas stove. No laundry machine to be found.

        <em>Blowholes:</em> Portions on a rock coast where over thousands of
        years the ocean has hallowed out a cave. The ceiling eventually
        collapses, opening up a hole where water can burst through in a
        spectacular show of power.

        I learn this and so much more on my Kayak tour. Also got a semi-decent
        picture of Cathedral Cove from my phone, and let's be honest - That's
        why I went to HaiHai.
      </p>

      <h4>Hot Water Beach</h4>
      <p>
        Just outside of HaiHai, there's a beach with a thermal spring right
        underneath it. At low tide, you can take a shovel, dig yourself a hole,
        and sit inside your own personal hot tub.

      <h4>Geothermal Wonderland</h4>
      <p>
        Rotorua is positioned relatively central horizontally, with a latitude
        about the same as HaiHai.
      </p>
      <p>
        In Rotorua, the Earth's crust is thinner than in most place around the
        world. As a result, there are active geysers, mud pools, and the whole
        city smells generally of rotten egg. (<em>
          Fun fact: I learned that British people sometime pronounce geyser the
          same as the American slang term geezer, or grumpy old man.
        </em>)
      </p>
      <p>
        The boiling mud pools reminded me of <em>The Land Before Time</em> and
        the minerals in Lake Rotorua gave it a beautiful blue color I thought
        existed only in water color paintings.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is also a random Redwood forest in Rotorua. Not much to say about
        that other than it was interesting and had some good short hiking.

      <h4>Waitomo Caves</h4>
      <p>
        I continued my trend of horizontal jumps (rather than making progress
        southward) with a stop in Waitomo.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are hundreds of caves in the area, with new ones being discovered
        yearly.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        A few years ago, a cow grazing in a field was started when the ground
        underneath him crumbled, opening up an entrance to a previously
        undiscovered cave right underneath his feet.
      </p>
      <p>I came into Waitomo to go on a glowworm "adventure" tour.</p>
      <figure className="align-left margin--right width--20 sm-width--100">
        <img src="../assets/img/blogs/newZealandNorthOverview/caving.jpg" />
        <figcaption className="caption">
          Take from website, since I wasn't about to bring my camera caving.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        The tour was challenging, exhausting, and rewarding. I can now add
        abseiling to my list of caving experiences
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>
          Abseiling: A controlled rope decent along a rockface. In this case,
          the drop was 27 meters, 88 feet, or 8 stories. Whichever sounds
          higher.
        </em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The glow worms in the cave surpassed my expectations. We sat in a cavern
        so dark that you couldn't see your hand in front of your face. From the
        moment the headlamps went off, light specs glowed on the ceiling. Ten
        seconds in, the light specs doubled. Twenty seconds in - there were full
        constellations.
      </p>
      <p>
        As beautiful as they were, we also learned about the not-so-dreamy parts
        of glow worms' lives. First off, glow worms aren't worms. They're
        maggots. When the first in a group of the maggot eggs hatch, they look
        around for food and cannibalistically turn to their brother and sisters
        who haven't quite made it out yet. In the next stage of their lives,
        they hang from ceilings, dropping silk strings down to catch insects
        attracted to the bioluminescent glowing from next to their butt. Once
        adult, they have no stomachs, so live only a short period, finding a
        mate, reproducing, and dying. What bizarre, beautiful creatures.
      </p>
      <p>
        The day after the blackwater rafting tour, I went to the tourist glow
        worm cave, ready to take pictures. Within the first five minutes, I
        found out that no cameras were allowed. Opps. The tourist cave was
        beautiful, but the tour was bland and short enough that I felt short
        change for the cost, but long enough that I tired of the guide. I'd
        recommend doing one of the adventure tours over the main tourist cave,
        assuming you're ok with dark spaces, long drops, and occassional rock
        climbs.

      <h4>Whanganui River</h4>
      <p>
        Finally making some south-bound progress, I headed down to Whanganui
        River.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        The Whanganui Journey is one of the nine{" "}
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_Great_Walks">
          great walks of New Zealand
        </a>. It's particularly famous for being leisurely boat ride down New
        Zealand's longest navigable river, not a walk.
      </p>
      <p>
        I went down the river with two British guys I had met the week before,
        and couldn't have asked for better people to travel with. The three of
        and our driver nearly doubled the population of Whakapapa (population
        8), the drop off point for the boat ride.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <em>Fun fact: </em> WH on the north island is pronounced like an F. Try
        reading Whakapapa out loud in a New Zealand accent.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mornings on the river were cold and foggy, but the boating was smooth.
        You only have to paddle ~50% of the time to make it down the river,
        barring bad weather or headwinds.
      </p>
      <figure className="align-left margin--right width--25 sm-width--50">

      </figure>
      <p>
        Staying at the huts along the river were adventures on their own. The
        first night, we shared the cabin with a group of goat hunters. They sat
        across the table from us, one pounding beer like he was a dehydrated
        college freshman, cleaning out their guns for the next day. Not sure
        I've even been that close to so many guns before.<em>(Not saying much for my 'murica status.)</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        After dinner (a 'boilup'' which they kindly shared with us), a group of
        them laid on their mattresses, curled up, and fell asleep watching
        Mohana.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">Goat hunting. What a job.</p>
      <p>
        Night two, we had the hut all to ourselves. We were (I was at least)
        freezing cold, and it took a whole box of matches & a wallet full of
        train ticket receipts to start the fire. We couldn't get the gas cooker
        working, so resorted to cooking dinner over the fire.

      <h3>Lord of the Rings</h3>
      <p>
        You can't get into New Zealand without having seen Lord of the Rings.
        Pretty sure that's a rule. Like they ask at customs, and kick you out if
        you haven't.
      </p>
      <p>
        But really, getting to see Hobbiton and the Weta Cave workshop (where
        prop work was done for <em>Lord of the Rings</em>) were quintessential
        New Zealand experiences.
      </p>
      <p>
        In summation of <bold>Hobbiton</bold>: Peter Jackson is crazy. It's very
        unusual to build a set out of permanent material (like Hobbiton is), it
        costs a lot of money. The tree above Baggens has over 5,000 hand painted
        leaves, hand painted because they were made the wrong color. Locals were
        encouraged to be extras in the film as long as they were short and had
        big noses.

        Weta Caves puts more energy, skillful craft, and enjoyment into their

        Creatures like Gollum first have a replica skull designed. From there,
        fake muscles are applied. Only then is the face crafted. This is how
        they're able to create such a wide range of emotions for their

      <h4>Traveling </h4>
      <p className="quote">
        Out of breath, you finally make it to the top of a 1,500 step hill...
        and then you realize you took a wrong turn at the bottom.
      </p>
      <p>
        Both literally and metaphorically, this happened multiple times during
        my first week in New Zealand. Jetlag from my 26 hour journey set me back
        for a week. I can't image spending or recommending anyone spend less
        than two weeks over here.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've known that I'm bad at adjusting to jet lag. Another thing I'm bad
        with: Cold weather. I was worried that coming to New Zealand during the
        winter would take so much out of the experience. On one hand, I haven't
        been able to enjoy the beaches, and it rains more this time of year than
        summer, which makes for less pretty sights and pictures. On the other
        hand, hostels and activities are cheaper and easier to book. I can show
        up day of somewhere and get a space on almost any tour. Twice now (once
        in Waitimo, and again on the North Island yesterday) I've been the only
        person in my hostel. This makes for a strange experience, but sometimes
        when traveling, surrounded by constant movement, it's nice to have a
        break and spend time alone.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's also helped that it isn't proper winter yet. It's still the fall,
        the leaves are changing and falling, and the hikes I've done have been
        more breath taking than I could image.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm heading down south now, and winter is actually coming. To be seen if
        my optimism and positive weather experiences will hold.

        The cities, wine, culture, and outdoor activities have lived up to and
        surpassed expectations. There are so many other positive and negative
        experiences I've left out as well, but it's sunny outside right now and
        I'm tired of typing. Almost as tired as you are of reading by now.
        Thanks for hanging in til the end. Special shout out to Henry, Mark, and
        every one of the other fantastic people I've met traveling so far if
        you're reading this. I'm looking forward to seeing the south island
        next, especially the Winter Festival in Queenstown later this month.
        Hang in for that post (<em>
